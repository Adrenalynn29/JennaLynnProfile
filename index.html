    <h2> About Jenna </h2>
       <p> After graduating highschool, I have tried many different carrers. From selling insurance, to serving tables, to teaching elementary school. I have gone off on many paths trying to find the right one. I graduated from Metropolitan State University with a Educational Studies degree. I have always had a passion for learning and experiencing new things. I have always been interested in coding and computer programming. I feel like I have finally found a path that I want to stay on. </p>
       <p> I am now a student of <a href = "http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. I can now pursue my dream of becoming a professional coder. </p>
       <p> From my experience working in restaurants, I know how to work with other people and communicate. From my experience as a teacher, I know that everyone functions differently and there are endless ways to approach problems and solve issues. I would be a valuable addition to any team, and I am always ready to learn new things.</p>
